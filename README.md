## Objective
The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance and risk of UK-relevant financial assets and assess what these differences imply for investment and portfolio decision-making.

## Core Business Question
**How do different UK-relevant financial assets perform in terms of return and risk, and what does this mean for investment decision-making?**

## Assets Analysed
- FTSE 100 Index – UK equities
- UK Government Bond ETF – lower-risk, defensive asset
- GBP/USD exchange rate – currency exposure
- S&P 500 Index – global equity benchmark

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) – data collection, cleaning, and analysis
- SQL – structured querying, aggregation, and comparison of asset metrics
- Power BI – interactive dashboard design and stakeholder reporting
- Excel – data validation and sense checks

## Methodology
1. Collected historical price data for each asset over a multi-year period.
2. Cleaned and aligned datasets to ensure fair comparisons.
3. Converted prices into comparable metrics such as returns.
4. Calculated risk measures including volatility and drawdowns.
5. Used SQL to aggregate performance and risk statistics.
6. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to communicate insights clearly.

## Key Metrics
- Daily and cumulative returns
- Rolling volatility
- Maximum drawdowns
- Correlation between assets
